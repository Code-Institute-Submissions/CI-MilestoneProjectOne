# CI-MilestoneProjectOne

uGym is a made-up gym based in Shavington, Crewe.

This website has been designed to display the offerings of this local gym to encourage the local populus to sign up to the gym.

The website has been designed to look professional and showcase the gym offerings.

### User stories

**Prospective Customer 1** 
This prospective customer is relatively well accustomed to the gyms in the local area, and is therefore looking to identify either the cheapest (or perceived best value) gym in the local area.

**Prospective Customer 2**
This prospective customer is keen to find the gym in the local area that caters for all of their training requirements, and therefore wants to be able to view all of the facilities in the gym.

**Prospective Customer 3**
This prospective customer is a fitness enthusiast, but is not a 'traditional' gym-goer, and is more interested in the different fitness classes that the gym has to offer.

**Prospective Customer 4**
This prospective customer is completely new to the world of fitness, and wants to be able to learn from friendly and knowledgeable personal trainers.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make the site very visual with lots of images, and minimal amounts of text for the customers to read. 
Ultimately the client is looking for a gym and just wants to see what facilities and services are available.

### Scope
The scope was to try and cater customers of all fitness levels & experience. Therefore it was very important to identify the key customers needs.

I narrowed this down to;

1. Cost
2. Facilities provided
3. Services provided (fitness classes etc.)
4. Personal training

### Structure

Ultimately, the cost of services is the biggest driver in customer purchases, and they want to get the most value for their money.

It was therefore key to highlight the cost of joining the gym in the first instance, which is clearly displayed as the customer lands on the site.

It was then important to show the value for money, and displaying all of the facilities, classes and personal training options provided by the gym.

Each of these can be easily navigated by scrolling down the page, or using the scrolling features in the navbar links.

It is also important for customers to be able to contact the gym should they need to.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)

## Features
### Nav Bar 
The navbar contains links to each section of the page, and a smooth scrolling feature has been added to make the site more professional.
This allows the prospective customer to quickly navigate to the information that they are looking for.

### Sign up button
There is a visible sign up button on the landing page, that the client can click on which opens a modal to allow the client to begin the sign up process and select the type of membership they would like.

### Facilities
The facilities section contains a carousel, which automatically scrolls through a number of images of the gym's facilities. 
The prospective customer is also able to cycle through the images at the click of a button.

###Contact
This section of the site details address, phone number and email address for the gym, as well as a 'send a message' modal, allowing a prospective customer to submit queries online. 

It also includes iframe of Google Maps displaying the location of the gym and the local area.

## Future Features to implement
The next iteration of the site should include calendar of the fitness classes available, detailing start & end times. This could be an additional webpage, or available for download (or both).

## Testing
I have run my HTML and CSS code through the W3C validation websites.

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

This allowed me to identify any issues with my code, such as incorrect/ missing closing of div tags, duplicate ID tags etc.

I frequently used [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) and Google DevTools, to allow me to test the responsiveness of my site across different devices & resolutions.
